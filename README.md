This is MERN project on student Management system.Actually MERN is the acronym for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js combination of Javascript-based technologies which are used to build advanced web applications.

MERN is full-stack, following the traditional 3-layered architectural pattern,
including the front-end layer (React.js), application layer (Express.js and Node.js), and database layer (MongoDB).

In this Project we have made a very Basic Student Management system in which student data can be showed or can be deleted simultaneously once you filled all the details in create student form which is shown on left after hand side after click on Ceate button so you can able to see the data in all left hand in table format and also we are able to delete student data based on student data beased on id.

We have used React Js components with Material UI (Javascript front end framework) for creating our front end which is running on localhost with port 3000 and backend we have ceated our server on Express Js (framework of Node Js) which is running on port no 5000 and for storing data we have used Mongo DB Atlas and for fetching data from API we have used Axios.
